            <p>This video highlights my skills as a video editor. I edited this video in Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects. Some Premiere Pro editing skills included in this video include fade-ins and fade-outs, text movement, speed alteration, continuity editing, appropriate pacing, and visual cuts lined up with audio cues. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Some Adobe After Effect skills featured include use of fractal noise, masking, blur effects, and write-on text animation. This video was created as a final project in COMMUN 4880 at the University of Missouri. I enjoy editing videos that have a strong audio presence because I like to edit on the beat and let the visuals reflect what you are listening to.</p> 
            <br />
            <p>Not only did this project teach me new editing skills, but I also learned the importance of storyboarding and pre-production. I shot all the footage featured in the video, and I had several instances where I had to reshoot scenes because the footage did not fit together. Overall, it was a great experience to make this music video, and I look forward to the chance for me to make a video like this again!</p>
