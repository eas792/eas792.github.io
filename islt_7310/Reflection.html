            <h3 class= "h3">Pre-college Plans</h3>

            <p>When I started college, I thought that I wanted to be a filmmaker. Ever since I was little, I have been intrigued by the filmmaking process and how filmmakers do what they do. My interest in filmmaking started when I watched the director’s commentary of the 2008 version of <em>Mamma Mia</em>. I thought that making films was what I wanted to do with my career, and so when I entered college I began taking film studies classes. I also decided on a communication major with an emphasis in media to study media relations.</p>

            <p>A year into my coursework at Mizzou, I realized that filmmaking wasn’t exactly my calling. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love the video production process. However, I didn’t see this as the best career for me. Instead, I thought editing would be more appropriate for my life goals. So, I added an information technologies minor to help teach me better editing skills.  </p>

            <h3 class= "h3"> Current Plans</h3>

            <p>My focus area in information technology started out on the media path, but I was also required to take some basic coding classes. At first, I was nervous to take these classes since I had zero experience with coding. However, I enjoyed them more than I thought. Through my time in the information technology program, I grew to love my coding classes, and now I will graduate with an information systems certificate along with my minor. I began to image a career that combined my love of films and media with a more technical side. </p>

            <p>Currently, my dream is to work for a film studio in their marketing or web development department. This way, I will still be contributing to an art form that I have appreciated for my whole life. I think my time at Mizzou has given me a great foundation for this line of work, and I am so excited for what the future holds!</p>
