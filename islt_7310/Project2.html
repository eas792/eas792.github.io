            <h3 class= "h3"> Motion Graphic Effects</h3>

            <p>This video highlights my skills as a motion graphic effects artist. All the effects showcased here were done in Adobe After Effects for INFOTC 3640 class projects. </p>
            <br />
            <p>The first clip shows usage of advanced lightening and lens flares. </p>
            <br />
            <p>The second video uses masking, green screen keylight, lower third graphics creation, and composite layers. </p>
            <br />
            <p>The third video utilizes reverse motion tracking, animated masks, the liquify tool, and adjustment layers. </p>
            <br />
            <p>The fourth video highlights motion blur. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Finally, the last video uses fractal noise, compositing, colorama, shatter, and circle effects. This class was the first time I had ever worked with After Effects, so there was a learning curve for me to figure out how the program worked. By the end of the class, I was very impressed with my skills and the different features of After Effects that I was able to master, such as key framing and compositing.  </p>
