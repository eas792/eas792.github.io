<p>This website acts as a virtual portfolio for me, Elizabeth Schlaker. The different pages highlighted here will give you an overview of my skills as a video editor, motion graphic effects artist, and filmmaker. When you are finished looking through my portfolio, I hope that you will be convinced that I am a good candidate for your job position.</p>
    
<br />
    
<p>This website will feature videos from multiple class projects as well as projects made through extracurricular organizations. Each video will be accompanied by a short description of the technologies used to create the project and my role in its creation. After viewing these videos, you should have a general understanding of my capabilities and the types of media that I am passionate about creating.</p>
