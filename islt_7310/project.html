            <h3 class= "h3">Video Editing</h3>

            <p>This video highlights my skills as a video editor. I edited this video in Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects. Some Premiere Pro editing skills included in this video include fade-ins and fade-outs, text movement, speed alteration, continuity editing, appropriate pacing, and visual cuts lined up with audio cues. Some Adobe After Effect skills featured include use of fractal noise, masking, blur effects, and write-on text animation. This video was created as a final project in COMMUN 4880 at the University of Missouri. I enjoy editing videos that have a strong audio presence because I like to edit on the beat and let the visuals reflect what you are listening to. Not only did this project teach me new editing skills, but I also learned the importance of storyboarding and pre-production. I shot all the footage featured in the video, and I had several instances where I had to reshoot scenes because the footage did not fit together. Overall, it was a great experience to make this music video, and I look forward to the chance for me to make a video like this again!</p>

            <h3 class= "h3"> Motion Graphic Effects</h3>

            <p>This video highlights my skills as a motion graphic effects artist. All the effects showcased here were done in Adobe After Effects for INFOTC 3640 class projects. The first clip shows usage of advanced lightening and lens flares. The second video uses masking, green screen keylight, lower third graphics creation, and composite layers. The third video utilizes reverse motion tracking, animated masks, the liquify tool, and adjustment layers. The fourth video highlights motion blur. Finally, the last video uses fractal noise, compositing, colorama, shatter, and circle effects. This class was the first time I had ever worked with After Effects, so there was a learning curve for me to figure out how the program worked. By the end of the class, I was very impressed with my skills and the different features of After Effects that I was able to master, such as key framing and compositing.  </p>

            <h3 class= "h3"> Filmmaking</h3>

            <p>This short film highlights my skills on set as a production assistant, slate supervisor, and grip. This film was produced, shot, and edited by a group of classmates for FILM_VS 3550 using a C100 camera, quasar lights, and a zoom field recorder. This film was difficult to make because we shot both at night and during the day. When we shot during the day, we had to make the inside of the house appear as though it was nighttime. When we shot outside at night, we had to light the scene well enough to capture clear images. I learned so much about how to properly light a scene, and since it was a small crew I got familiar with all the on-set departments.</p>
