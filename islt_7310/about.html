<h3>Education Overview</h3>

<p>Currently I am a junior at the <strong>University of Missouri</strong>. I will graduate December 2022 with a Bachelor of Art in Communication along with minors in information technology, film studies, and Spanish. I will also graduate with an information systems certificate, media technology and design certificate, multicultural certificate, and honors college certificate. </p>

<br />

<p>For the past two years I have worked as a Resident Advisor with the <em>Department of Residential Life</em>, and this past semester I began working as a marketing intern at a local bond company. On campus I serve on the executive board of Mizzouâ€™s communication honors society, <em>Lambda Pi Eta</em>, as secretary. I am also treasurer of <em>Shot Reverse Shot</em>, a student run video production organization. For six semesters I have been a member of <em>Little Sisters of the Gold Rose</em>, a service sorority. </p>
