Hello everyone! My name is Elizabeth Schlaker and I am a junior at the University of Missouri. I am working towards a bachelors degree in communication with an emphasis in media. I am also pursuing minors in information technology, film studies, and Spanish. Currently I am a marketing intern for a local bond company where I work with search engine optimization and writing posts for our companyâ€™s blog. On campus I am involved in a video production organization as well as a service sorority. In my free time I like to watch movies, make crafts, and listen to music. One day I hope work in either website development or the entertainment industry. I do not have any previous web application experience, so I am very excited for this course to teach me these useful skills. After taking this class I hope to have a general understanding of HTML that I can apply to any future job.
